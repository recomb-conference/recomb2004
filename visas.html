      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The US-VISIT system, in which visa holders entering the US
        are digitally fingerprinted and photographed, went into effect on
        Monday. Although there have been reports of significant delays at some
        airports, the system overall seems to be operating smoothly so far. This
        program does not apply to citizens of the 27 countries in the visa waiver
        program. However, there are a couple of points of which your societies
      should be aware:</font></p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><ol>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Dept. of Homeland Security (DHS) admits it has not done a
        great job of international outreach on this system, although there has
        been a lot of international press coverage. If you are planning a
        meeting at which you expect many foreign visitors, in addition to
        sending information about the new visa policies, you may wish to make them
        aware that upon arrival at an air or sea port, they can expect to be
        fingerprinted and photographed. In the future, they will have to undergo a
        similar procedure upon exiting the country - although this has not yet
        been implemented. In the next 2 years, those entering by land will be
        expected to comply, as well.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The current policy of DHS is to protect the information
        collected in a manner similar to compliance with the Privacy Act, as if
        the visitor was a US citizen. This is not a statutory requirement, so it
        is subject to change in the future, but more info is available at:
        <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/interweb/assetlibrary/USVISIT_Privacy_Poliicy.pdf">http://www.dhs.gov/interweb/assetlibrary/USVISIT_Privacy_Poliicy.pdf</a></font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the next steps in implementation of the US-VISIT program is
        expected to cause significant problems. By October 26, 2004, all countries
        in the visa waiver program (almost all European) are supposed to issue
        biometrically enabled passports - they'll have an embedded computer chip
        containing a digital photograph and possibly fingerprint data. It is
        expected many of these countries will be unable to meet this deadline, at
        which point their citizens will be required to have a visa to enter the
        US. Unfortunately, there is currently no statutory loophole that would
        allow the US to grant countries extensions on this deadline. The travel
        industry and business interests are lobbying hard to change this, and I
        suspect they will be successful, but be aware that if this deadline
        remains firm, it could have serious impact on Europeans'
        ability to travel to the US.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
		One Brazilian city has begun fingerprinting US travelers in
        retaliation for the new US-VISIT program. Although this appears to be an
        isolated incident, there is a concern that other countries will
        institute such a policy as well. Or they may choose to adopt the system
        because it has proven successful in the US. US travelers going abroad
        should be aware that this is a possibility.</font></li></ol></font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the system moves forward, or should any new information arise, FASEB
        will pass it along. </font></p></tr>
