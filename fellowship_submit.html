    RECOMB is pleased to announce funding opportunities for students and postdoctoral fellows to attend the RECOMB 2004 conference in San Diego, California.  
</font></P><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
    <strong>IMPORTANT NOTE, PLEASE READ:</strong> Due to concerns from several applicants
    regarding the ability to cancel registration if not accepted for a travel
    fellowship, the following policy change has been made:</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Applicants who have applied for a travel fellowship and registered for
  RECOMB 2004 prior to 11:59pm PST January 21, 2004, will be allowed to
  cancel their registration with no penalty if not selected to receive a
  travel fellowship.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Applicants who apply for a travel fellowship after January 21, 2004, are
  not required to register for the RECOMB 2004 conference until acceptance
  notices are sent out February 12, 2004. At that time, recipients of
  travel fellowships will be given 15 days to register for the RECOMB 2004
  conference (please note early discount registration deadline is February
  15). Failure to register by February 27, 2004, will result in
  forfeiture of travel fellowship awards. This ensures that successful
  applicants will receive the discounted early registration fee, while not
  penalizing unsuccessful applicants who are then unable to attend the
  conference due to lack of funding.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Applicants who register for RECOMB 2004 and apply for a travel fellowship
  after January 21, 2004, will be governed by the standard RECOMB 2004
  cancellation policy as stated on the registration page at
    <a href="registration.html">http://recomb04.sdsc.edu</a></font></p>
